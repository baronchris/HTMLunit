                <blockquote>
                        I must not fear. 
                        Fear is the mind-killer. 
                        Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. 
                        I will face my fear. 
                        I will permit it to pass over me and through me. 
                        And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. 
                        Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain
