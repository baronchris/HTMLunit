            <h1>formatting demo page</h1>
            <P>This simple page demonstrates the formatting tags covered in this lesson.</P>
            <h2>bold and strong</h2>
            <p> <b>This text is bold</b> <br>
            The strong tag has the same visual effect as the bold tag but the strong tag also<br>
            marks the enclosed text as more important. It is also easier for screen readers<br> 
            to read for the visually disabled. <strong>This is what strong text looks like.</strong></p>
            <h2>Italic and Emphasis</h2>
            <p> <i>This is what text in Italics looks like.</i><br>
            The emphasis tag has the same visual effect as the italic tag but the emphasis tag<br> 
            also marks the enclosed text as more important. It is also easier for screen readers<br>
            to read. <em>This is what emphasized text looks like.</em></p>
            <h2>Subscript and Superscript</h2>
            <P>Subscript text looks like this: <sub>This is subscript.</sub><br><br>
            Superscript text looks like this: <sup>This is superscript.</sup><br></P>
            <h2>Inserted and deleted text</h2>
            <p> <ins>inserted</ins> and <del>deleted</del></p>

            <p><mark>Marked text</mark></p>
            <h2>Blockquote</h2>
            <p> <blockquote> I must not fear. <br>
                        Fear is the mind-killer. <br>
                        Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.<br> 
                        I will face my fear. <br>
                        I will permit it to pass over me and through me. <br> 
                        And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. <br> 
                        Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.<br>
                         Only I will remain.</blockquote></p>
